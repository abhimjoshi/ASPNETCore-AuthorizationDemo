# ASP.NET Core Authorization Demo

[![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dqsceugeqf12tpvr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/henningst/aspnetcore-authorizationdemo)

This repository contains an ASP.NET Core solution demonstrating how you can implement custom authorization handlers using the new Authorization story in ASP.NET Core.

The solution contains a webapp using MVC and a Test project using xUnit. The test project shows how you can unit test your authorization handlers.

You can read some more details in my blog post on http://blog.stoverud.no/posts/how-to-unit-test-asp-net-core-authorizationhandler/.
